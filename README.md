# Frozen [ICE]

 


Intro
==========================
Frozen is a new energy friendly, highly anonymous and fast paced cryptocurrency created to solve current challenges in the economic system by enabling small loans based on smart contracts on a secure blockchain peer to peer network provided by MasterNode System.

Actively working on development and improvement, we have created a new network layer consisting of servers working together in clusters called SmartNodes. Using the highly eco and starter friendy algorithm C11, everyone can mine their own ICE without ASIC or NiceHash attacks! Also to protect the value of this project there will be a near implementation of Proof-of-Stake.

Specifications
==========================
Symbol: ICE
Algorithm: C11
Emission: 100,000,000 ICE
Block Time: 60 seconds
Difficulty POW: DGW3
Difficulty POS: SeeSaw
Masternode: 20,000 ICE

Technology
==========================
* Hybrid PoW/PoS Masternodes
* Stealth addresses
* Encrypted Messaging
* Multi-Signature Addresses & TXs
* Fast 60 Second Block Times
* New C11 PoW Algorithm for PoW
* SHA256d Algortihm for PoS Hybrid

Development process
===========================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of Denarius.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.
